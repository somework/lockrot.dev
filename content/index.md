# lockrot

**Finds abandoned, unmaintained and branch-pinned packages in `composer.lock` — and releases that
promise a PHP version they were never tested against.**

## Install

=== "Composer plugin"

    ```bash
    composer require --dev somework/lockrot
    composer config allow-plugins.somework/lockrot true
    composer lockrot --target-php=8.4
    ```

    Adds one dev dependency and one command. It also prints a short summary during
    `composer require`, `update` and `install`, above the operations list — see
    [Install-time summary](install-time.md).

=== "PHAR"

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL -o lockrot.phar https://lockrot.dev/lockrot.phar
    php lockrot.phar --target-php=8.4
    ```

    Nothing is added to your project. For the checksum-verified download and how
    `self-update` works, see [PHAR and self-update](phar.md).

=== "Global plugin"

    ```bash
    composer global require somework/lockrot
    composer global config allow-plugins.somework/lockrot true
    ```

    `composer global update` keeps it current. Because it is a plugin rather than a
    PHAR, the install-time summary then runs in every project you touch;
    [Install-time summary](install-time.md) explains how to turn that off.

Requires PHP 7.4 or newer and Composer 2.2 or newer.

The first 21 lines of a real run against wallabag's 200-package lock file, at 100 columns. Four of
its 75 findings — [read the whole report](example-run.md).

A whole run on a smaller project, 52 packages, from the command to the summary block and the footer:

![lockrot in a terminal: two critical and five high findings with their evidence, then the summary counts by verdict and priority and the "Data as of" footer](assets/lockrot-demo.gif){ .lockrot-demo width="1228" height="884" loading="lazy" }

## What it looks for

- **`abandoned`** — the package's own repository says so: Packagist carries the `abandoned` marker a
  maintainer set by hand, or the repository is archived on GitHub or GitLab.
- **`silent`** — five years with no stable release *and* five years with no push to the repository,
  on the default thresholds. Nobody announced anything; the package simply stopped.
- **`pinned`** — your lock file holds a branch snapshot (`dev-master`, `dev-main`) or a commit hash
  instead of a released version, so the thing you installed has no version number anyone else can
  ask for.
- **`old-promise`** — the release predates the PHP version you are upgrading to, and its
  `require.php` constraint is open-ended (`>=7.2`), so Composer accepted it on a PHP nobody released
  it against. `composer check-platform-reqs` is satisfied too: `>=7.2` is true on 8.4.

A fifth verdict, `stale`, catches a package that is old on one of those fronts but not both — worth
knowing, rarely worth acting on. Every finding carries the evidence behind it, the date the data was
read, and the chain of requirements that pulled the package in — what `composer why` shows for one
package, for every finding at once: every direct requirement it is reachable from, not only the
shortest one, and each direct requirement says what it pulls in.
[What it reports](verdicts.md) has all eight verdicts and the priority rules.

## "Composer already warns me about abandoned packages"

It does: `Package X is abandoned, you should avoid using it` on every install, and
`composer audit --abandoned` reports the same packages. Both read one field: the `abandoned` marker
a maintainer sets by hand on Packagist. Most packages that stop being maintained never get it,
because setting it is the last act of someone who has already walked away — so the field is
accurate when it is there, and silent the rest of the time. `composer outdated` answers a different
question, whether a newer version exists: a package can be fully up to date and dead, or two majors
behind and fine.

lockrot reads that field too, and then keeps going. It asks when the last stable release actually
landed, when the repository was last pushed to, whether your lock file is holding a branch snapshot
rather than a version, and whether a release made an open-ended PHP promise it was never tested
against. It reads `composer.lock` and `composer.json`, and it writes to neither.

## In CI

Nothing fails a build until you ask it to: `fail-on` is `none` by default, exit `1` means a finding
reached the threshold you chose, and exit `2` is reserved for lockrot's own errors. On GitHub
Actions, `uses: somework/lockrot-action@v1` is the whole step. Recipes for that, GitLab CI and PR
comments are in [In CI](ci.md); a [baseline](baseline.md) lets you accept what you have today and
fail only on what arrives tomorrow.

## Questions

### Does it change `composer.json` or `composer.lock`?

No. It reads both and writes to neither. The only file it ever writes is the
[baseline](baseline.md), and only when you pass `--generate-baseline`.

### Can it break `composer install`?

Not unless you ask it to. The [install-time summary](install-time.md) prints at most 10 lines
within a 5-second budget and never stops the transaction; a failed lookup is reported, not raised.
`install-time-strict` is the opt-in that lets it stop one, `"install-time": "off"` turns the summary
off for a project, and `LOCKROT_DISABLE=1` silences lockrot for one command.

### Do I need a GitHub token?

No, but it sees more with one. Anonymously GitHub allows 60 requests an hour, so lockrot checks
repository activity only for packages whose releases already look stale, at most 50 per host per
run, and reports how many the cap affected. With `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, or Composer's own
`github-oauth`, every package is checked.
[How it fetches metadata](internals.md#repository-hosts-and-credentials) has the GitLab and
Bitbucket rules.

### Does it work with Private Packagist, Satis or a mirror?

Yes, with nothing to configure. lockrot reads the repositories already in your `composer.json`
through Composer's own repository layer, with Composer's authentication and proxy settings.

### Does it work offline, and what happens when the network fails?

`--offline` serves everything from Composer's cache and lockrot's own. A network failure never
turns into a non-zero exit code on its own: the check that could not run is reported as a note.
`--strict-network` makes it exit `1` instead.

### The project already has dozens of findings. Where do I start?

With a [baseline](baseline.md): `--generate-baseline` records what is there today, and CI then
fails only on findings that are new or have got worse.

### A package is finished, not abandoned. How do I say so?

Interface packages, frozen polyfills and metapackages are not rot. `psr/*`, `fig/*`,
`symfony/polyfill-*` and a few more are on the built-in allowlist and report `finished`; for
anything else, add an entry with a reason to `extra.lockrot.ignore` —
[the allowlist](configuration.md#the-allowlist).
